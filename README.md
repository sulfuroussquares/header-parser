# Request Header Parser

---

This microservice will be able to take in parameters related to a requested timestamp, and return a JSON formatted response with that timestamp
in UNIX and UTC formats.

The functionality will look something similar to [this](https://request-header-parser-microservice.freecodecamp.rocks/).

---

I will need an HTML landing page, and on that page a description of the service.
The user will then be able to browse to a URL _(i.e. http://<webpage>/api/whoami)_, then receive a JSON formatted response containing the request
header data.

### Implementation

#### Credit

The idea for this project (and base fork boilerplate with no functionality) comes from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).  
I used [Glitch](https://glitch.com/) as a quick way to build/test a Node-based webapp without having to set up a local repository on my machine.
